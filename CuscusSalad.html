        <img src="C:\Users\maloc\repos\odin-recipes\recetas-vegetarianas-faciles.jpeg">
        <p> This easy cuscus salad is brimming with flavor and texture. Loads of</p>
        <p>fresh vegetables, herbs and creammy feta cheese makes this recipe </p>
        <p>perfect for lunch, a picnic or an easy side dish</p>
        <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
        <ul>
        <li><em>Couscous</em></li>
        <li><em>Vegetables such as cucumber, cherry tomatoes,radishes and red onions Other salad veggies like red bell peppers,carrots and spring onions can also be used</em></li>
        <li><em>Fresh herbs. I used fresh basil, parsley and chives.Fresh mint and dill will be delicious too</em></li>
        <li><em>Feta cheese</em></li>
        <li><em>Chickpeas</em></li>
        <li><em>For the dressing:I love a simple vinaigrette with couscous salad with lots of extra-virgin olive oil, fresh lemon juice/red wine vinegar, fresh garlic cloves, salt and black pepper. </em></li>
        <li><em>Optional extras: This salad is so versatile and you can add a whole lot more to it. Kalamata olives, nuts (almonds or pine nuts), raisins, corn, black beans etc. can all be added. Chopped cooked chicken is also great for a huge protein boost.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Steps</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the couscous: Add the couscous to a large metal or glass bowl then pour over the boiling water (you can use chicken stock too if you want more flavor) and season with a pinch of salt. Cover with plastic wrap or a plate and allow to soak for 10 minutes then fluff with a fork.</li>
            <li>Prepare the vegetable: Finely dice the vegetables. I donâ€™t like keeping the veggies too chunky for this salad so I quarter the cherry tomatoes and finely chop the red onion and cucumber. Drain and rinse the chickpeas under cold water then allow to drain for a few minutes before adding to the salad.</li>
            <li>Assemble: Make the dressing then add all the vegetables and herbs to the couscous along with the feta cheese. Stir to combine with the dressing, taste and adjust seasoning if necessary then serve.</li>
        </ol>
